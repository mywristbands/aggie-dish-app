# aggie-dish-app
Displays interactive menus for eateries at UC Davis.

## Preliminary Notes
This app was created in collaboration with Emily Brickey, Ronald Guerra, and Joanne Change for our Senior Design Project course at UC Davis. The course lasted for two quarters, or about 6 months.

Unfortunately, I cannot display the code written for this project, as it is private to the client we created it for (Naji Dmeiri). However, I have been given permission to provide links to a video and poster, linked below, that we created at the end of the project to give an overview of the app.

Note that this is just the start of a longer-term project. New Senior Design Project teams have already begun expanding on our work and adding new features to the project.
